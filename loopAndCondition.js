//in javascript have same as java for,while,and do-while loop 

// for loop 

let output=""
for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){
    output+=i+" ";
}
console.log(output);  // print 1,2,3,4,5 in String form

// while-loop in javascript-->>
let count=1;
output="";
while(count<=5){
    output+=i+" ";
}
console.log(output);  // print 1,2,3,4,5 in String form

// do-while loop
count =1;
do{
   output+=i+" ";
   count++;
}while(count<=5);   

// main difference between while and do-while is , while first check the condition and than do something.
// but do-while first do something and after check the condition..
// there have or two loop but this loop are use most...
